On 20th October, GDSC conducted a Treasure Hunt styled event called **"Campus Quest"** where students gathered in teams of 2-4 and embarked on an exciting adventure across our campus, where they'll unravel enigmatic riddles to unveil hidden QR codes and seize the grand prize!

📅 Date: Tuesday, 5th September 2023   
🕰 Time: 9:00 am - 3:00 pm   
📍 Venue/Help-Desk: Area behind the Main Staircase

Since this was our first event for the academic year, it was **free for everyone** to participate. We had an overwhelming **participation of over 60 Teams, and a little over 100 participants**. There were 2 Prize Categories, one was Open-to-all, and the other was the Freshers Category. **Each category had a winning price of 40AED!**
